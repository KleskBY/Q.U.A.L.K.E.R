<group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0">
-------- KEYS --------
<target key="target" name="Target">The name of the entity targeted for projection.</target>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.
</group>

<point name="_skybox" color="0.77 0.88 1.0" box="-4 -4 -4 4 4 4">
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">Rotation angle of the sky surfaces.</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).</angles>
<real key="_scale" name="Scale" value="64">Scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.</real>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

<flag key="CRUSHER" name="Crusher" bit="2">Door will not reverse direction when blocked and will keep damaging player until he dies or gets out of the way.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname"). Note: func_door and func_plat targeted by a misc_model will also require a trigger_* entity with the same target key/value as the model.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: It will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.

In genuine bot arena matches, the podium for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place players at the end of the match is generated by this entity. The podium's origin will automatically be located 128 units in the direction of the camera's view and 84 units down from the y height of the view line at that point. It will also always be generated on a level plane regardless of the pointing angle of the camera so if that angle is too steep, part of the podium model might not be visible. Make sure you leave at least 106 units of free space in front of where the camera points to otherwise the podium model won't be visible at all.

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="No Drop To Floor" bit="0">Item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

<integer key="gridsize" name="Dynamic Light Granularity" value="64 64 128">Granularity of the lightgrid, created by q3map, which is used to dynamically light certain game objects, like players and items. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 64 64 128. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.</integer>
<integer key="_blocksize" name="BSP Block Size" value="1024 1024 1024">Map compiler splits the BSP tree along axial planes (X, Y and Z) for optimization. It does it as often, as specified in _blocksize key for respective axis (in units) (default 1024 1024 1024, 0 = disable, setting single value 'N' equals to setting 'N N N'). I.e. lower values result in more splits and vice versa. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density. Maps, having flat architecture, might work better with horizontal splits disabled ('N N 0').</integer>
