# Q.U.A.L.K.E.R
Stalker conversion to quake.


<p>This is an indie project with great potential that can grow into an MMO shooter in the stalker universe. Using a modern fork of Quake (DarkPlaces) I was able to transfer many parts of the Stalker game (weapons, locations, monsters, gameplay mechanics) to a lighter engine with stable multiplayer. Due to the fact that this is essentially a quake, it plays as if it were Half-Life or Counter-strike.</p>
<p>What do we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 giant levels.</li>
<li>16 new guns including sniper rifles, shotguns and even Gauss gun.</li>
<li>5 new monsters types (blind dog, bloodsucker, zombie, snork, grunt)</li>
<li>Atmospheric ambient.</li>
<li>Working deathmatch PVP survival with mutants.</li>
<li>Anomalies and more.</li>
<li>Compatibility with original Quake maps (you can play on standard maps with new opponents and weapons).</li>
</ul>
<p>What is planned to be added in the near future:</p>
<ol>
<li>A store where players can buy weapons, armor and other equipment.</li>
<li>Survival mode where players will have to defend a bunker from waves of mutants.</li>
<li>Expand the number of mutants. Add mutants from builds.</li>
<li>Port original multiplayer modes.</li>
<li>Android support.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is planned to be added in the foreseeable future if the project is popular (it won&rsquo;t happen):</p>
<ol>
<li>Several servers with different locations and transition between them.</li>
<li>Factions and the war between them. For example, &ldquo;Duty&rdquo; is fighting with &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;, individuals are fighting with bandits, and &ldquo;Monolith&rdquo; protects the approaches to the center of the zone.</li>
<li>Playing as zombified and other mutants.</li>
<li>Blowout and dynamic events. Day and night cycle.</li>
<li>Quests, story line and economy depending on the player&rsquo;s actions.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>Problems:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>If games take hours to load - try another executable. Perhaps you are low on RAM or running an x32 bit engine.</li>
<li>If FPS is very low, open settings and switch lighting to HIGH or NORMAL.</li>
<li>If the game looks bad, it looks like nothing on screenshots (no lighting, shadows, etc), open setting and switch lighting to MAXIMUM.</li>
<li>If your antivirus says something, you can remove all executables and download original darkplaces from the developer's website (<a href="https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/">https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/</a>). I recommend darkplacesenginewindows64only20180908beta1.</li>
<li>If you can't find your goal, pay attention to the red cross on the compass.</li>
<li>You may get stuck inside walls and get insane fps drops in some places because stalker meshes are not optimized for quake engines.</li>
</ul>
